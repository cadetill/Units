# Units
Units with classes, records, interfaces, ... with specific information in each one

All code comments into the units are formatted for [PasDoc](https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc)

### TWBControl

Contains the uWBControl unit. 
The uWBControl unit contains the definition and implementation of the classes needed to manage a HTML loaded into a TWebBrowser.
You can get information about forms, images and links. You can read and set values of different elements from a Form. You can submit a form too.
That unit work with HTML pages with or without Framesets. In case no exists frameset, this unit create one without name.
Only valid for Windows. If someone wants to transform the unit to multiplatform, I will appreciate it xD
